# Image Processing Model for Predicting Land-Sea Ratio in Tires

## Project Overview
This project involves the development of an image processing model using Python and OpenCV. The model is designed to predict the land-sea ratio of any tire based on tire images. This ratio is a key factor in understanding tire tread patterns and their suitability for different driving conditions.

## Features
Automated loading and preprocessing of tire images
Application of HSV color space conversion for enhanced feature detection
Advanced algorithms for accurate prediction of the land-sea ratio

## Technologies Used
Python
OpenCV
Matplotlib (if used in visualization)

## Installation
 Clone the repository
```git clone [your-repository-url]
```

Navigate to the project directory
```cd [your-project-directory]```

Install required Python packages
```pip install opencv-python matplotlib (add other packages as necessary)```

## Example of how to use the model
from your_module import TireLandSeaRatioPredictor

 Initialize the predictor
```predictor = TireLandSeaRatioPredictor()```

# Predict the ratio
ratio = predictor.predict('path_to_tire_image.jpg')
print(f"Predicted Land-Sea Ratio: {ratio}")
